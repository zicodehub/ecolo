## Inspiration

I and many other students have had complaints about remote learning. School isn't the same without being inside of a classroom; Zoom classes and Google Classroom don't provide the same experience as the physical classroom. For months, I have thought about how this issue could be solved, and concluded that simulating a classroom with augmented reality would be an excellent choice.

## About The Project

With ScholAR, students log in using the ScholAR web app. They can then navigate to their classes (which appear in 3D space) and select any one they want. Students will see the outside of their classroom, which includes the class agenda for the day and their assignments, all of which appear right in front of them for easy access. If a class is in session, a student will be able to enter the classroom, where they will be fully immersed into the lesson.

### Built with

* [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/)


## Note
Web App is optimized for mobile. On iOS, AR will only work on Mozilla's XRViewer. On Android, app will require HTTPS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
